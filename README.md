# Jack Schreuder Project Proposal

## Domain of Interest

#### Background

I propose a project based around studying the ecology and visitation of the US national parks, specifically broken down based on state. Which states have the most land allocated for national park conservation, and which of these states receive the most visitors. Is there a relationship here, and if there is, what can it tell us about the modern practice of enclosing the commons and/or the creation of a mythic frontier to solve a crisis of masculinity.
- Why am I interested in this subject?
  - Whether or not National Parks are a part of some sort of odd quest to recreate "frontier living" and harden so called "soft" modern men, they are some of the last remaining untouched pieces of wilderness in the United States, and in the whole world. Therefore, it is important to understand if National Parks are in fact meaningfully intact tracts of well preserved land.
  - Which states (maybe which parks too) have the most visitors, and what do those places tell us about who might be visiting?
- What other examples of data driven project have I found that relate to this subject?
  - [This article](https://www.williamcronon.net/writing/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html) by William Cronen explores the idea that mainstream environmentalism may have confused the general population in terms of whether National Parks are some of the last places that (as Cronen puts it) civilization, the human disease, has not fully infected. Cronen cites a lot of Transcendentalist writing and historical data to determine whether National Parks were created to conserve nature, or as a way for "soft men" to get back in touch with a supposedly more masculine version of themselves, ie some character in line with the Teddy Roosevelt rough-rider archetype.
  - [A second article](https://www.outsideonline.com/culture/books-media/leave-it-as-it-is-david-gessner-book-excerpt/) talks about the idea that National Parks were created as "empty places", but what this really means is places untouched by European settlers. When the first national parks where made, the word wilderness was synonymous with "place Indians were". Gessner (the author) points out that the idea of National Parks as "untouched" lands is particularly cruel to the indigenous people that used to live as stewards of that land.
